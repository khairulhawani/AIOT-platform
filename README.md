## Operation
Using Docker Compose is basically a three-step process:

Define your app's environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced anywhere.
Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment.
Lastly, run docker compose up and Compose will start and run your entire app.
